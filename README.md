# Web-Scraping-Project

First we need to identify the website for each scraper as in my case i had the same website 
Collect the URL of the selected pages from where you want to extract data 
Third step involves making a request to these URLS to get the HTML of the page 
At the end save the data either in CSV/excel(scrapy) form or display in the terminal (Beautiful soup, Selenium) 

To extract data through Beautiful soup i used tags and attributes for scrapy and selenium i provided x_paths to get the desired output.
